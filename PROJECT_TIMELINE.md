## 👥 Team Contributions

**Note:** While initial roles were defined at the project start, the team worked collaboratively throughout the entire development process. Each member contributed to multiple areas beyond their primary role, helping each other across all phases of development.

| Team Member          | Primary Role      | Main Focus Areas                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anuj Tanwar**      | Lead Developer    | Led development, core detection logic, architecture design, risk assessment algorithms, integration work |
| **Lokendra Patidar** | GUI Developer     | GUI implementation, interface design, real-time monitoring display, user experience                      |
| **Aman Bijore**      | Support Developer | Functionality support, testing, documentation preparation, bug fixes, integration                        |

### Development Collaboration

The team followed a highly collaborative approach where members actively supported each other:

- **Planning Phase:** All members contributed to requirements gathering and architecture decisions
- **Core Development:** Anuj led the detector engine implementation with input from Lokendra and Aman on integration points
- **GUI Development:** Lokendra designed and built the interface with assistance from Anuj on backend connectivity and Aman on feature testing
- **Documentation:** Aman coordinated documentation efforts with contributions from all team members
- **Testing & Bug Fixes:** All members participated in testing, identifying issues, and implementing fixes
- **Integration:** Joint effort across the team to ensure seamless component integration

The collaborative spirit meant that when one member was working on a feature, others would jump in to help, review code, suggest improvements, and handle related tasks. This approach resulted in a more robust system and better knowledge distribution across the team.
