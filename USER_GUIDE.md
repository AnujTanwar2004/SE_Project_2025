## Common Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Monitor for Data Theft

**Goal**: Detect if malware is capturing sensitive documents

**Steps**:

1. Start the application
2. Click "Start Monitoring"
3. Open sensitive documents
4. If any suspicious process tries to capture, you'll see an alert
5. Check the "Real-Time Monitoring" tab for details

### Scenario 2: Verify Legitimate Software

**Goal**: Ensure your screen recording tool is recognized

**Steps**:

1. Start monitoring
2. Use your screen recording tool (e.g., OBS, ShareX)
3. Check if it appears in detections
4. If it's marked as HIGH risk but it's legitimate:
   - Note the process name
   - Add it to the whitelist (see Configuration section)

### Scenario 3: Security Audit

**Goal**: Review all screen capture activity over time

**Steps**:

1. Run monitoring for a day/week
2. Go to "Real-Time Monitoring"
3. Click "Export to CSV"
4. Open the CSV in Excel
5. Analyze patterns and suspicious activity

## Understanding Risk Levels

### CRITICAL ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Definition**: Known malware patterns detected
- **Examples**: Processes with "keylogger", "stealer", "trojan" in name
- **Action**: Immediately investigate, consider terminating process
- **Auto-blocked**: If enabled in settings

### HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Definition**: Suspicious screen capture by unknown process
- **Examples**: Unfamiliar .exe files capturing screen
- **Action**: Investigate process origin and purpose

### MEDIUM ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Definition**: Potentially legitimate but unusual activity
- **Examples**: Python scripts, development tools
- **Action**: Verify if you initiated the activity

### LOW ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- **Definition**: Whitelisted apps with minor anomalies
- **Examples**: Legitimate tools behaving slightly unusual
- **Action**: Generally safe, monitor for patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No detections appearing

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure monitoring is started (green "Running" status)
2. Try using a screen capture tool (Windows Snipping Tool)
3. Check if the tool is whitelisted
4. Review logs tab for errors

### Problem: Too many false positives

**Solutions**:

1. Increase scan interval in Settings
2. Add trusted applications to whitelist
3. Disable "Alert on Medium Risk"

### Problem: Application won't start

**Solutions**:

1. Verify Python installation: `python --version`
2. Reinstall dependencies: Run `install.bat`
3. Check logs folder for error details
4. Run as Administrator

### Problem: High CPU usage

**Solutions**:

1. Increase scan interval to 3-5 seconds
2. Close other resource-intensive applications
3. Ensure you have latest Python version

## Advanced Features

### Exporting Data for Analysis

1. Click "Export to CSV"
2. Open in Excel or Python/R
3. Filter by risk level
4. Create pivot tables for patterns
5. Generate charts for reporting

### Running as Windows Service

For always-on protection:

1. Install NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)
2. Use NSSM to create a service pointing to `main.py`
3. Configure service to start automatically

### Integrating with SIEM

1. Configure logs to output JSON format
2. Use log forwarding to send to Splunk/ELK
3. Create dashboards and alerts

---

## Best Practices

1. **Run as Administrator**: For full functionality
2. **Regular Log Reviews**: Check weekly for patterns
3. **Keep Whitelist Updated**: Add legitimate tools
4. **Export Regularly**: Maintain historical records
5. **Combine with AV**: Use alongside antivirus software
6. **Document Incidents**: Note unusual detections
7. **Test Periodically**: Verify detection is working
