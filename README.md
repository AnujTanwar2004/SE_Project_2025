## üîç How It Works

### Detection Mechanisms

#### 1. Process Monitoring

The system continuously scans running processes using `psutil` and checks for:

- Suspicious process names (e.g., containing "screenshot", "capture", "screengrab")
- Known malicious patterns (keylogger, stealer, spyware)
- Processes not in the whitelist performing screen-related operations

#### 2. Windows API Monitoring

Monitors calls to common screen capture APIs:

- `BitBlt()` - Copies bitmap data
- `GetDC()` - Gets device context
- `CreateCompatibleBitmap()` - Creates bitmap objects
- `PrintWindow()` - Captures window contents

#### 3. Behavioral Analysis

Analyzes process behavior including:

- Command-line arguments containing screen capture keywords
- Window title analysis
- Parent-child process relationships
- Network activity patterns

#### 4. Risk Classification

| Risk Level   | Description                           | Examples                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **CRITICAL** | Known malware patterns                | Processes with "keylogger", "stealer" in name |
| **HIGH**     | Suspicious screen capture activity    | Unknown processes with screenshot commands    |
| **MEDIUM**   | Potentially legitimate but suspicious | Python scripts performing screen capture      |
| **LOW**      | Minor anomalies                       | Whitelisted apps with unusual behavior        |

### Whitelist (Trusted Applications)

- Windows Snipping Tool (`SnippingTool.exe`)
- Windows Snip & Sketch (`ScreenSketch.exe`)
- ShareX (`ShareX.exe`)
- Greenshot (`Greenshot.exe`)
- Microsoft Paint (`mspaint.exe`)
- OBS Studio (`obs64.exe`, `obs32.exe`)
- Discord (`Discord.exe`)
- Microsoft Teams (`TEAMS.exe`)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Alert Settings

Edit settings through the GUI or modify `detector.py`:

```python
# Whitelist customization
WHITELIST = {
    'SnippingTool.exe',
    'YourTrustedApp.exe'
}

# Blacklist customization
BLACKLIST = {
    'keylogger',
    'stealer',
    'malicious_pattern'
}
```

### Scan Interval

Adjust in GUI Settings tab or in `detector.py`:

```python
time.sleep(1)  # Change from 1 to desired interval
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access Denied" errors

**Solution**: Run as Administrator

```powershell
# Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí Run as Administrator
python main.py
```

### Issue: Module not found errors

**Solution**: Reinstall dependencies

```powershell
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: High CPU usage

**Solution**: Increase scan interval in Settings tab (recommended: 2-3 seconds)

### Issue: False positives

**Solution**: Add trusted applications to whitelist in `core/detector.py`

### Issue: GUI doesn't respond

**Solution**: Ensure Python 3.8+ and all dependencies are installed

```powershell
python --version
pip list
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Permissions

- **Standard User**: Basic monitoring capabilities
- **Administrator**: Full functionality including auto-block and system-wide monitoring

### Privacy

- All logs stored locally
- No data transmitted externally
- Executable paths and window titles recorded for forensic analysis

### Limitations

- Cannot detect kernel-mode screen capture
- May not detect highly sophisticated malware using rootkit techniques
- Relies on behavioral patterns that can potentially be bypassed
- Whitelist-based detection can be circumvented by name spoofing

### Recommendations

1. **Run as Administrator** for full protection
2. **Keep whitelist updated** with legitimate applications
3. **Regularly review logs** for suspicious patterns
4. **Combine with antivirus** for comprehensive protection
5. **Update regularly** as new threats emerge
